The goal of this activity is to import different datasets with CSV formatting into an SQL Database, which in this case is PostgreSQL, to get valuable outcomes by generating different data transformations withing the application.

The goal of this analysis was to create an in-depth exploration of employees that used to work in the company during the 1980's and 1990's performing Data Engineering and Data Analysis. 

To be able to understand on how to structure the data and make connections between the different databases, an ERD Diagram was designed:

Afterwards, in PosgreSQL all the datasets were imported for data manipulation for further analysis.

A connection to a Jupyter Notebook using sqlalchemy was done once the data engineering was finished in PosgreSQL to be able to further manipulate the information and get better insights of it. The libraries imported as dependencies to run the data exploration was Matplotlib, Pandas as Numpy.

Her are displayed some of the outcomes of the study:
